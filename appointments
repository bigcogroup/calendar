// Initialize the calendar as an array of 24 elements, representing 24 hours in a day.
let calendar = new Array(24).fill("available");

// Function to book an appointment at a specific hour.
function bookAppointment(hour) {
  // Check if the hour is already booked.
  if (calendar[hour] === "booked") {
    console.log("Appointment at hour " + hour + " is already booked.");
  } else {
    // Book the appointment.
    calendar[hour] = "booked";
    console.log("Appointment at hour " + hour + " has been booked.");
  }
}

// Example usage:
bookAppointment(10); // Book appointment at 10am.
bookAppointment(12); // Book appointment at 12pm.
bookAppointment(14); // Book appointment at 2pm.
bookAppointment(10); // Attempt to book appointment at 10am again (should fail).
//This program creates a calendar as an array of 24 elements, representing the 24 hours in a day. Each element in the array is initially set to "available". The bookAppointment() function takes an hour as an argument and checks if the appointment is already booked. If it is, the function prints an error message. Otherwise, it books the appointment by setting the corresponding element in the calendar array to "booked" and prints a success message.

//You can modify this program to suit your specific needs, such as adding additional features like cancelling appointments or displaying the calendar visually.
